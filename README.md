# C++ Sandbox
## Caleb Maddry
### 2 February 2025

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...
I used to be able to competently code in C++.
After two years of Python, R, and MATLAB, I seemed to have lost this skill. 
Welcome to my journey in relearning the art of C++ programming.
Feel free to follow along as I start over :)
